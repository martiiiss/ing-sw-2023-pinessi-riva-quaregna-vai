Since I cannot put comments in json files I'll add them in here:
-The json Files are to be read from left to right and from top to bottom
      0   1   2   3   4
 0  |   |   |   |   |   |
 1  |   |   |   |   |   |
 2  |   |   |   |   |   |    --> A schematic representation of how I intend the matrix
 3  |   |   |   |   |   |
 4  |   |   |   |   |   |
 5  |___|___|___|___|___|

-The 12 JSON files are named following the numbers of the given Personal Goal Cards
 inside the folder given by resources, I'll personally make sure that those png are easy
 to link to the pgc (at the moment the only thing that you'll notice is that if you look for
 Personal_Goals inside the folder 17_MyShelfy_BGA those are numbered as the JSON files I made)
