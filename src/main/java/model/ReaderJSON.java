/** I'm still trying to understand how this actually works.
 *  Online I found plenty of different ways to write the code used to read JSON files
 *  but each one of them is different in some way, also I still have to think if having 12 different JSON
 *  is actually a great idea or if it's better to have a single big file divided into 12 pieces.
 *
 *  Also, the code is incomplete and I have to try to compile it to see if it has any sense before completing it**/
